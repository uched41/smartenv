### Smart information support system for Internet of Robotic Things.

This experiment lays the ground work for a more complex information support system for internet of robotic things. It is not always feasible to equip a robot with all the sensors and devices required for complete autonomous operation. In addition to this, data from sensors is often prone to noise or malfunction. An information support system enable us to build minimalist robots and offload more complex but non-critical tasks to a processing node. In turn, minimalist robots will cost less and be more power efficient.
